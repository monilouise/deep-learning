# General Domain Portuguese Language Model

This is an on-going language model implementation for Portuguese (Wikipedia based corpus).  

- AWD-LSTM based architecture <a href="#DBLP58journals47corr47abs4517084502182">[3]</a>
- Vocabulary size: 30,000 words
- Based on <a href="http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html">fast.ai ULMFit approach</a> <a href="#DBLP58journals47corr47abs4518014506146">[1]</a>

## Files

- PT_Language_Model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with data preparation and several experiments.  The data preparation are strongly inspired by Telugu Language Model <a href="https://github.com/binga/fastai_notes/tree/master/experiments/notebooks/lang_models">[4]</a>.
- PT_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests.ipynb / PT_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests.py: Scripts for training for 10 epochs a pretrained (for 2 epochs) model based on 1cycle <a href="#DBLP58journals47corr47abs4518034509820">[2]</a>.  Python scripts (.py) are easier to run due to difficulties with long execution times in Jupyter notebooks. 
- PT_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests-From-Scratch.ipynb / PT_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests-From-Scratch.py: Scripts for running for 10 epochs a model from scratch based on 1cycle <a href="#DBLP58journals47corr47abs4518034509820">[2]</a>.  Python scripts (.py) are easier to run due to difficulties with long execution times in Jupyter notebooks.  PS.: I created these scripts after not seeing advantage in running for 10 epochs from a pretrained model, as suggested by T_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests.ipynb / PT_Language_Model-1Cycle-Tests.py:
